PR in Canada
The ease of obtaining Permanent Residency (PR) in Canada for IT professionals can depend on various factors such as your age, education, work experience, and the province's immigration policies. Here are some considerations and recommendations:

---

### 1. **Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs):**
   - **Ontario (Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program - OINP):**
     - Since you’re already in Toronto, Ontario is a convenient option.
     - The **OINP Tech Draw** targets IT professionals with skills in high-demand occupations (e.g., software developers, computer programmers).
     - However, Ontario is competitive, and you may need a high Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score or a job offer.
   
   - **Saskatchewan (SINP):**
     - Saskatchewan offers the **SINP International Skilled Worker: Occupations In-Demand** stream, which might be a good fit for IT professionals.
     - The CRS cut-off in Saskatchewan is typically lower, and you don’t always need a job offer.

   - **Alberta (AAIP):**
     - Alberta's PNP program is known for lower CRS thresholds.
     - IT occupations are in demand, and the province prioritizes candidates already living in Canada.

   - **British Columbia (BC PNP):**
     - The **BC Tech Program** is tailored for IT professionals. However, a job offer from a BC employer is usually required.

   - **Atlantic Provinces (AIPP or Provincial Streams):**
     - The Atlantic provinces (Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island) have programs under the **Atlantic Immigration Pilot Program (AIPP)** and PNPs that are often less competitive.
     - These regions may be suitable if you’re open to relocating and can secure a job offer.

### 2. **Express Entry:**
   - You can create an Express Entry profile and aim for the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP) or Canadian Experience Class (CEC).
   - Your diploma in computer programming may add points under education, and your IT experience is an asset.
   - However, being 50 years old might lower your CRS score due to age. A Provincial Nomination can add 600 points to your Express Entry profile, ensuring an Invitation to Apply (ITA).

### 3. **Family Considerations:**
   - Since your family is already in Canada, staying in Ontario might be the easiest option for stability and convenience.
   - Look for programs where your spouse’s skills or experience might also contribute to the application.

### 4. **Key Steps to Take:**
   1. Assess your eligibility for Express Entry and create a profile.
   2. Explore PNPs in provinces where IT skills are in demand.
   3. Strengthen your application by securing a job offer, if possible, as it increases your chances in many programs.
   4. Consider language tests (IELTS/CELPIP) to maximize CRS points.

### 5. **Recommended Provinces for Your Profile:**
   - **Ontario**: If you can qualify under the OINP Tech Draw.
   - **Saskatchewan**: If your CRS is low or you lack a job offer.
   - **Alberta**: If you meet eligibility and the CRS threshold is manageable.
   - **Atlantic Provinces**: If you’re open to relocating.
